**Github Pages**
The Project Homepage for this site is a "Project Pages site owned by a user account", see https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/

I've configured the Project Homepage to be from the /docs folder in the master branch:
https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/

Note that the old 'Automatic Page Generator' has been deprecated: Github web UI->(repository)Settings->Automatic Page Generator (see https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/)

**Dictionaries and Formats**
To see how many 'headwords' are in a dictionary count the number of lines in its .index file, e.g:
wc -l wikt-deu-eng.index
62824 wikt-deu-eng.index

Dictionaries are stored under /usr/share/dictd

**Packaging - Adding a New Language**
To create Debian packages for a newly added language, e.g. French (ISO code fra):
- Copy one of the existing stanzas in debian/control for both wikt-eng-fra and wikt-fra-eng
- Copy one of the existing postinsts to wikt-eng-fra.postinst and wikt-fra-eng.postinst
- Create wikt-eng-fra.install and wikt-fra-eng.install (see the other .install files for what to put in them)

**Editing wiktionary**
Example translations section:
====Translations====

{{trans-bottom}}

{{trans-top|A computer network access point}}
* German: {{t|de|Gateway|n}}, {{t|de|Protokollumsetzer|m}},
{{trans-bottom}}

**Linux dictionary data sources**
freedict.org - dictionaries written in a standardised XML format. Looks like they've imported data from various sources but it's probably quite a manual process. Some dictionaries are good (German-English) but some are lacking (Spanish-English)

wiktionary (to download use: http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/enwiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2) - for most words in the English Wiktionary there are translations into various languages on the page. Quickdic for Android parses the dumps from Wiktionary to create their own dictionaries.

TU Chemnitz - An excellent English<->German dictionary, serves as the base of ding and the default Eng<->Ger dictionary in Quickdic. Also seems to be available for dictd and may at some point have been imported into freedict.org.
