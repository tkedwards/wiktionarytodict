Most words in the English Wiktionary have a 'translations' section where users have contributed translations from that word to various different languages. wiktionarytodict uses the data in those translation sections to generate dictionaries.\r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\n#### Downloading the pre-made Dictionaries\r\nThe simplest way is to download the program [Goldendict](http://goldendict.org) which is available for Linux and Windows. Goldendict can read the [DICT format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICT) dictionaries generated by wiktionarytodict directly. The pre-generated dictionaries are [downloadable here](https://github.com/tkedwards/wiktionarytodict/downloads).\r\n\r\nAnother good option for Linux users is to install dictd and place the wiktionarytodict dictionaries in /usr/share/dictd. You can use the Debian packages available [here](https://github.com/tkedwards/wiktionarytodict/downloads) or do it manually, see the instructions for Ubuntu for example: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DICT\r\n. Once you have dictd installed you can use the dictionaries via any of the many dictd-compatible (RFC2229) client programs on Linux.\r\n\r\n#### Generating your Own Dictionaries\r\nYou'll need at least a Linux installation and very basic familiarity with the bash shell. Download the project files. Run wiktionarytodict.sh to get usage information or look at regenerate_all.sh, which is a script I use to generate the dictionaries on my own machine.\r\n\r\nGenerating dictionaries is fairly processor intensive. On a desktop PC with a Quad-Core AMD Phenom II X4 (3GHz) CPU it takes about 15 minutes to generate each dictionary.\r\n\r\n### I've found an error in one the dictionaries/I want to add an entry\r\nJust head over to the [English Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org), find the word in English and edit the translation for the relevant language. wiktionarytodict doesn't alter the data in any way - it just reflects what was on Wiktionary at the time the dictionaries were generated.\r\n\r\n### What languages does this support and how good are the dictionaries?\r\nwiktionarytodict can generate dictionaries for any language where there are translation entries on the English Wiktionary. So for languages like German and Spanish you'll probably get a pretty decent dictionary, whereas the more exotic languages people put there like Old Norse will probably produce a pretty limited dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe data is only as good as what's on the English Wiktionary, so if you want to improve it edit Wiktionary.\r\n\r\nDictionaries currently pre-generated for English<->German, English<->Spanish, English<->Dutch, English<->Norwegian (others on request)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTim Edwards (@tkedwards) liststuff@fastmail.com.au\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have problems raise an issue in https://github.com/tkedwards/wiktionarytodict/issues\r\n\r\n### License and Disclaimer\r\nwiktionarytodict is free and open-source software licensed under the GPL V2.
