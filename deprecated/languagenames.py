# Maps language names as seen in the Wiktionary dump files (e.g. 'German') to ISO-639-3 three-letter codes for those languages (e.g. 'deu' for German)
# The best way to find the ISO-639-3 code is to just look the language up on Wikipedia, as most languages have different codes for their many different variations.
