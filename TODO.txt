**Improvements**
- better formatting:
        * when going from a language that has noun genders such as Spanish back to English it should show the noun gender on its own line. Look at the dictionary format from trans-de-en e.g:
        Haus
        (n) house (abode), house (dynasty, familiar descendance)
        would be better as:
        Haus
        {n}
        house (abode)...
        * descriptions should be on their own line when going from English, eg: (eng-spa)
                park
                (a place for recreation)
                parque (m)

- deal with {{qualifier|someword}} properly

- instead of just using wiktionary data bring in data from other dictionaries, e.g Freedict, or even other language Wiktionaries (e.g. fuse data from Spanish and English wiktionaries to make Eng<->Spa dictionary). See Quickdic Android app for an example

- deal with sub-languages properly, e.g. by going off the ISO 3-letter language code (e.g nob is Bokm책l Norwegian) or have the user input it, eg. Norwegian-Bokm책l.
sub-languages lines begin with '*: ' (no quotes):
* Norwegian:
*: Bokm책l: {{t|nb|skjerm|m}}, {{t|nb|lerret|n}}
*: Nynorsk: {{t|nn|skjerm|m}}, {{t|nn|lerret|n}}, {{t|nn|lereft|n}}
Examples of sub-languages are Nynorsk and Bokm책l as the two alternate writing systems of Norwegian, Egyptian Arabic as a sub-lang of Arabic, Old Armenian as a sub-language of Armenian, Chinese sub-languages such as Dungan, Mandarin and Wu, Cyrillic and Roman spelling systems in Serbian.

- have wiktionarytodict create StartDict format files http://www.stardict.org/HowToCreateDictionary

- implement a progress bar/display during creation, see python3-progressbar and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1001871/showing-progress-of-pythons-xml-parser-when-loading-a-huge-file
