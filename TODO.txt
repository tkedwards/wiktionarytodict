**Possible improvements**
- upload packages to Debian project and to website

- look at using the python processing module to take advantage of machines with multiple cores

- deal with {{qualifier|someword}} properly

- deal with sub-languages properly, e.g. by going of the ISO 3-letter language code (e.g nob is Bokmål Norwegian) or have the user input it, eg. Norwegian-Bokmål.
sub-languages lines begin with '*: ' (no quotes). Examples of sub-languages are Nynorsk and Bokmål as the two alternate writing systems of Norwegian, Egyptian Arabic as a sub-lang of Arabic, Old Armenian as a sub-language of Armenian, Chinese sub-languages such as Dungan, Mandarin and Wu, Cyrillic and Roman spelling systems in Serbian.

- better formatting:
	* when going from a language that has noun genders such as Spanish back to English it should show the noun gender on its own line. Look at the dictionary format from trans-de-en e.g:
	Haus
        (n) house (abode), house (dynasty, familiar descendance)
	would be better as:
	Haus
	{n}
	house (abode)...
	* descriptions should be on their own line when going from English, eg: (eng-spa)
		park
		(a place for recreation)
		parque (m)

**Bugs to Fix**
- Fix:
	From Wiktionary English to Spanish [wikt-eng-spa]:

 	 south
  	(of or pertaining to the south) f}}, sureño]] {{m}}, f}}, f}}


- Fix:
	From Wiktionary English to Dutch [wikt-eng-nld]:

  	welcome
  	(greeting given upon someone's arrival) welkom]]!

- Fix:
	From Wiktionary English to German [wikt-eng-deu]:

  array
  (large collection) Fülle]] {{f}}; [[Reihe]] {{f}}; [[Feld]] {{n}};
  [[Zahl]] {{f}}; [[Anzahl]] {{f}}


- Fix not handling where wiktionary has both Bokmål and Nynorsk spellings for Norwegian. This could apply to other languages which have this weird split of multiple spelling systems. Example:
{{trans-top|the viewing area of a movie}}
* Arabic: {{t|ar|شاشة|f|tr=shaasha}}
* Armenian: [[էկրան]] (ēkran)
* Chinese: [[屏]] (píng), [[屏幕]] (píngmù), [[銀幕]], [[银幕]] (yínmù)
* French: {{t+|fr|écran|m}}
* German: {{t+|de|Leinwand|f}}
* Italian: {{t-|it|schermo|m}}
{{trans-mid}}
* Japanese: {{t|ja|スクリーン|tr=sukurīn}}, {{t|ja|銀幕|tr=ginmaku}}
* Norwegian:
*: Bokmål: {{t|nb|skjerm|m}}, {{t|nb|lerret|n}}
*: Nynorsk: {{t|nn|skjerm|m}}, {{t|nn|lerret|n}}, {{t|nn|lereft|n}}
* Portuguese: {{t+|pt|tela|f}}, {{qualifier|Portugal}} {{t+|pt|ecrã|f}}
* Russian: {{t+|ru|экран|m|tr=ekrán}}
* [[Scottish Gaelic]]: {{t-|gd|sgàilean|m|xs=Scottish Gaelic}}
* Spanish: {{t+|es|pantalla|f}}
* Turkish: {{t|tr|ekran}}
{{trans-bottom}}
