**Possible improvements**
- Catch exceptions and print the data that was being processed at the time, e.g this happened while processing for Norwegian:
  File "/home/tim/devel/wiktionarytodict/wiktionarytodict.py", line 46, in process
TextElement
    self.parseTranslations(content)
  File "/home/tim/devel/wiktionarytodict/wiktionarytodict.py", line 67, in parseTr
anslations
    self.parseTranslationline(aline, currentMeaning)
  File "/home/tim/devel/wiktionarytodict/wiktionarytodict.py", line 75, in parseTr
anslationline
    rawtranslation = aline.split(':')[2].lstrip()
IndexError: list index out of range

- upload packages to Debian project and to website. Sign packages with timedwards@fastmail.com.au gpg key (gpg currently defaults to old tkedwards key)

- deal with {{qualifier|someword}} properly

- instead of just using wiktionary data bring in data from other dictionaries, e.g Freedict, or even other language Wiktionaries (e.g. fuse data from Spanish and English wiktionaries to make Eng<->Spa dictionary). See Quickdic Android app for an example

- deal with sub-languages properly, e.g. by going off the ISO 3-letter language code (e.g nob is Bokm책l Norwegian) or have the user input it, eg. Norwegian-Bokm책l.
sub-languages lines begin with '*: ' (no quotes):
* Norwegian:
*: Bokm책l: {{t|nb|skjerm|m}}, {{t|nb|lerret|n}}
*: Nynorsk: {{t|nn|skjerm|m}}, {{t|nn|lerret|n}}, {{t|nn|lereft|n}}
Examples of sub-languages are Nynorsk and Bokm책l as the two alternate writing systems of Norwegian, Egyptian Arabic as a sub-lang of Arabic, Old Armenian as a sub-language of Armenian, Chinese sub-languages such as Dungan, Mandarin and Wu, Cyrillic and Roman spelling systems in Serbian.

- have wiktionarytodict create StartDict format files http://www.stardict.org/HowToCreateDictionary

- better formatting:
	* when going from a language that has noun genders such as Spanish back to English it should show the noun gender on its own line. Look at the dictionary format from trans-de-en e.g:
	Haus
        (n) house (abode), house (dynasty, familiar descendance)
	would be better as:
	Haus
	{n}
	house (abode)...
	* descriptions should be on their own line when going from English, eg: (eng-spa)
		park
		(a place for recreation)
		parque (m)
