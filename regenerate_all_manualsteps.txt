**Package creation complete. Manual steps remaining:**

*Upload the Package to the PPA*
- Uploaded the new source package to the PPA with:
dput -f ppa:tkedwards/wiktionarytodict-ppa wiktionarytodict_VERSION_source.changes

- Wait for the packages to build (https://launchpad.net/~tkedwards/+archive/ubuntu/wiktionarytodict-ppa then 'View Package Details') and then publish (should be all automatic, takes up to 10 mins) and then test the packages (see 05Testing/)

- If the test was successful then go to https://launchpad.net/~tkedwards/+archive/ubuntu/wiktionarytodict-ppa, login to Launchpad and select View Package Details->'Copy Packages' for each supported distro version (e.g. trusty, wily, xenial). (make sure to only copy binaries)

*Create a release on Github*
- Check any changes into git and Github (https://github.com/tkedwards/wiktionarytodict)

- Create the release using the Github web interface with Tag '20140402' (replace with current date) and name/title '2014-04-02' (current date). Create a ZIP file witkionarytodict-20140402 (replace with current date) made up of all files in $SCRIPTDIR/packaging/wiktionarytodict-VERSION/ *except* the debian directory. Drap-and-drop the .zip file onto the 'Attach binaries for this release by dropping them here'

- Update the download links in docs/index.md, commit the changes and push to origin. Check http://tkedwards.github.io/wiktionarytodict/ (it should update automatically)

*Clean-up*
- To save space, delete $SCRIPTDIR/packaging/wiktionarytodict-VERSION/ (the contents of it are preserved in $SCRIPTDIR/packaging/wiktionarytodict_VERSION.orig.tar.gz and ...diff.gz) and, if not using Launchpad and instead using binary packages, move $SCRIPTDIR/packaging/*.deb to the local repo
